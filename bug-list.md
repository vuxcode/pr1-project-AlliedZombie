1. Problem: *Wasted alot of time because forgot about array placement. Wrote [1] because I wanted the first one (Should have been [0]) but realized a while later after building the playerDamageBy*** function that that was indeed wrong...didnt want to hardcode it into the function so thats why I really wanted the array to work*
