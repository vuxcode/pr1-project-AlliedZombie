Most of the documentation is in the [bug-list](/bug-list.md) or inside the [index](/index.html) as comments.

### **Experiences:**
- Learnt more about JS and CSS. The Style-dock was fun to code in CSS with animations and such since that was new to me and the JS was nice because I noticed how much better I've become since the start of the course. I had some big problems which I was proud of solving (etc bug list 3-4).

- I adapted the structure of the game to be a better experience for the user. Instead of having a timer that makes it harder and harder for the user to reach the end, its now accessible for anyone and does not punish the users reaction-time. Aswell as matching the color of the buttons and enemies to furthermore increase the user experience.


### **Improvements:**
With alot more time I could probably:
- Make a tutorial with highlights of the buttons aswell as forcing the user to learn how to play.
- Add sound effects.

### **Budget Conclusion:**
Spent it almost right. I didnt have any SFX and spent that time into the enemy loop instead. Spent more of my time with improving the game experience instead. I made a promise that the game would be harder and harder but that was changed. And also that the program shouldnt have fancy animations or a page with gameplay rules **which I did**.   

# Project Summary

This is a small game that only uses three buttons. The user could attack with the mouse on the screen or use the buttons **"A"**, **"S"** or **"D"** to use the right attacks for the right enemy. If the user uses the wrong attack the user will be damaged. If the users HP fall down to 0 the player dies and will be shown their highscore. The users goal should be to survive for 30 seconds and defeat as many enemies as possible. The end result is not punishing the users reaction-time and tries to be user friendly by having the enemies and buttons use the same color.
